  <h2>My Updated Roadmap for 2025 (Q2-Q4)</h2>
  <p>
    Over the last few years, I have evolved from a curious Ruby beginner to a DevOps-focused engineer deploying scalable, secure infrastructures. As we enter Q2 of 2025, it's time to reflect on what I've accomplished in the first quarter and refine my focus for the remainder of the year.
  </p>

  <h3>Q1 2025 Accomplishments & Pivot Decisions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong><a href="https://linkarooie.com" target="_blank" class="text-accent hover:text-accent-dark">Linkarooie Migration</a></strong>: 
      <p>
        Completely pivoted from the original Rails 8 upgrade strategy by porting <a href="https://linkarooie.com" target="_blank" class="text-accent hover:text-accent-dark">Linkarooie</a> from Rails to Astro to reduce technical overhead and maintenance costs. While Linkarooie was always open source, this migration from Rails with Kamal to Astro on GitHub Pages eliminated the need for managing Ruby dependencies, complex database migrations, and Rails upgrade cycles. This strategic shift better aligns with my vision of creating low-maintenance, easily deployable tooling for the community.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong><a href="https://boganhustler.deanlofts.xyz" target="_blank" class="text-accent hover:text-accent-dark">Bogan Hustler Game Development</a></strong>: 
      <p>
        Created <a href="https://boganhustler.deanlofts.xyz" target="_blank" class="text-accent hover:text-accent-dark">Bogan Hustler</a>, a "Dopewars clone but Straya" using Vite, TypeScript (with strict types), Astro, GitHub Pages, Vitest, and Tailwind CSS. This project allowed me to apply modern TypeScript practices with strict typing while creating something fun and culturally relevant. I incorporated real-world Australian data and integrated SunoAI to generate a custom soundtrack that plays during gameplay, exploring the creative application of AI beyond just code assistance.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong><a href="https://blog.deanlofts.xyz" target="_blank" class="text-accent hover:text-accent-dark">Blog Modernization</a></strong>: 
      <p>
        Upgraded my <a href="https://blog.deanlofts.xyz" target="_blank" class="text-accent hover:text-accent-dark">personal blog</a> to Astro 5.2 and Tailwind 4, embracing the latest web technologies. This move further consolidated my tech stack and eliminated the maintenance overhead of multiple frameworks, allowing me to focus more on content creation and less on technical maintenance.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong><a href="https://linuxforpirates.deanlofts.xyz" target="_blank" class="text-accent hover:text-accent-dark">Linux for Pirates Expansion</a></strong>: 
      <p>
        Significantly expanded and republished <a href="https://linuxforpirates.deanlofts.xyz" target="_blank" class="text-accent hover:text-accent-dark">Linux for Pirates</a>, growing it from 50 to approximately 300 pages. This comprehensive resource now covers significantly more ground in Linux fundamentals, containerization, and modern DevOps practices, fulfilling the "Deepening Linux and Ubuntu Fundamentals" goal from my original roadmap in a more structured, shareable format.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>AI/ML Project Focus</strong>: 
      <p>
        Developed several AI and machine learning projects using <a href="https://github.com/loftwah/hoops-hustler" target="_blank" class="text-accent hover:text-accent-dark">Gradio and Streamlit</a>, including fantasy tools leveraging the NBA API and a game comparison tool using RAG. These projects allowed me to explore practical AI applications beyond the original roadmap's focus on Cursor for code assistance, shifting toward building end-user tools powered by AI rather than just using AI as a development aid.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Infrastructure Strategy Realignment</strong>: 
      <p>
        Made the decision to retire Kamal deployment strategies (mentioned in the original roadmap) in favor of a clearer separation: AWS ECS for professional work and Astro with Cloudflare (Functions, D1, KV, R2) for personal projects. This decision simplifies my tech stack by creating specialized tooling for different contexts rather than trying to maintain a single approach for all scenarios. For professional systems requiring containers, AWS ECS provides enterprise-grade orchestration, while Cloudflare's edge platform offers a perfect balance of simplicity and power for content-focused personal projects.

  <h3>Updated Project Philosophy</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Maintenance Reduction & Simplification</strong>: 
      <p>
        A new guiding principle that has emerged is the intentional reduction of maintenance overhead. By moving from Rails to Astro, from self-managed servers to Cloudflare edge, I'm systematically eliminating time spent on updates, patches, and infrastructure management. This philosophy wasn't explicitly stated in my original roadmap but has become central to my decision-making.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Practical Solutions</strong>: 
      <p>
        Continue to build tools that solve real problems rather than chasing technological fads, but with a stronger emphasis on tools that have staying power and don't require constant attention—like <a href="https://github.com/loftwah/grabit" target="_blank" class="text-accent hover:text-accent-dark">GRABIT.SH</a> and <a href="https://linuxforpirates.deanlofts.xyz" target="_blank" class="text-accent hover:text-accent-dark">Linux for Pirates</a>.
      </p>
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Knowledge Sharing & Community Growth</strong>: 
      <p>

      <strong>Decisive Technology Choices</strong>: 
      <p>
        Make clear, intentional decisions about which technologies to embrace versus retire, cutting through the noise of endless options to maintain focus and expertise in specific areas. This represents a maturation of my approach from my original roadmap, which tried to expand in many directions simultaneously.

      <strong>Work-Life Balance Through Automation</strong>: 
      <p>
        Maintain balance between professional work, personal projects, and family life by actively automating repetitive tasks and choosing technologies that require less ongoing maintenance, freeing up time for both focused creative work and family priorities.
      </p>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Balancing Work and Life Through Technical Choices</h3>
  <p>
    As a father, managing time and energy remains crucial. My pivot toward lower-maintenance technologies directly supports this priority. By moving from Rails (with its upgrade cycles, dependency management, and security patches) to Astro (with its simpler deployment model and content-focused architecture), I've reduced the "background noise" of technical maintenance that was consuming evenings and weekends.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    Similarly, the shift from DigitalOcean with Kamal to Cloudflare's edge platform eliminates server management, security patches, and scaling concerns—all things that previously created unpredictable demands on my time. These technical choices aren't just about technology preferences; they're strategic decisions to reclaim time for family and focused creative work.
  </p>

  <h3>Conclusion: From Implementation to Innovation</h3>
  <p>
    This updated roadmap reflects both what I've accomplished in Q1 2025 and the significant pivot in my technical direction. The original roadmap focused heavily on Ruby/Rails modernization, Kamal deployment on DigitalOcean, and gradual improvements to existing systems. The new direction embraces Astro, Cloudflare edge computing, TypeScript, and AI-powered tools—representing not just different technologies but a fundamentally different approach to building and maintaining systems.
  </p>
  
  <p>
    By intentionally reducing maintenance overhead, focusing on technologies with staying power, and building more substantial educational resources, I'm creating space for deeper innovation while maintaining a sustainable balance between work and personal life. The goal remains the same—transitioning from a skilled implementer to an industry innovator—but the path has been refined based on real-world experience and evolving priorities.
