  <h2>My Roadmap for 2025</h2>
  <p>
    Over the past few years, I've transformed from a beginner in Ruby and Rails
    to a Senior DevOps Engineer capable of deploying scalable, secure
    infrastructures. Migrating a 13-year-old Rails app to AWS wasn't just a
    technical challenge—it taught me the importance of breaking big problems
    into manageable steps and trusting in my ability to learn what I didn't
    know. This roadmap is a reflection of my ongoing journey to grow, innovate,
    and contribute meaningfully to the tech community while preparing to take on
    new challenges like offering professional services.
