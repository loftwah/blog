	<h2>Hi, I'm Dean "Loftwah" Lofts</h2>

	<p>
		I’m a passionate AWS-certified Senior DevOps Engineer with a strong focus on cloud infrastructure, Ruby, Golang, and Docker. I thrive on optimizing systems and processes to ensure performance and scalability, while keeping the cost-effectiveness of cloud solutions in mind. With years of experience, including my time in the Royal Australian Navy, I’ve honed a unique perspective on both technical and strategic challenges.
	</p>

	<p>
		When I'm not engineering solutions, I’m also known as Loftwah The Beatsmiff, a music producer with a love for beat-making. I've had the pleasure of working with artists like Grind Mode Cypher and OptiMystic MC, merging my passion for music with my technical expertise to produce something truly unique.

	<h3>Life Outside of Tech</h3>
	<p>
		Away from the terminal, I enjoy spending time with my family and exploring new ideas in the world of tech. I also run a tech-focused YouTube channel and write articles to share my learnings with others. When I get the chance, I love diving into a good book, cycling, and curating beat-making sessions.
