2025 is shaping up to be another big year for me, and staying sharp means relying on a stack that's battle-tested, productive, and just plain fun to use. This year, I've refined my toolkit with the tech I trust most for building, scaling, and experimenting. If you're curious about what powers my projects, here's a personal look at my tech stack for 2025.

---

## Programming Languages

Some people stick to one language. I like to mix things up. Whether it's scripting, backend, or systems-level work, I use the right tool for the job:

- **Python**: My go-to for scripting, APIs, and diving into AI/ML experiments.
- **Node**: JavaScript remains a powerhouse for server-side development.
- **Ruby**: Clean, expressive, and perfect for Rails apps.
- **Rust**: When I need safety, speed, and precision. No compromises.
- **Go**: A joy to work with for scalable backends and CLI tools.
- **JavaScript/TypeScript**: The workhorses of modern frontend and full-stack work.
- **Bun**: I’ve been loving how fast and modern this Node alternative feels.
- **Uv**: Optimising Python runtimes for performance where it matters.

---

## Databases

Every great app needs a solid foundation. Here’s where I trust my data:

- **Postgres**: Rock-solid, relational, and always reliable.
- **Redis**: Lightning-fast caching and real-time storage.
- **SQLite**: Perfect for local or lightweight embedded storage.

---

## Backend Frameworks & Libraries

The frameworks that make building APIs and backend systems a breeze:

- **Rails**: My first love. Still unmatched for rapid, full-stack development.
- **FastAPI**: Blazing-fast Python framework for clean and performant APIs.
- **Sidekiq**: Background job processing that just works.

---

## Frontend Tools

Fast, modern, and clean frontend development keeps me happy:

- **Tailwind**: Utility-first CSS for building beautiful UIs without the bloat.
- **Vite**: Super fast frontend tooling that makes dev work seamless.

---

## Web Servers & Infrastructure

Where it all comes together:

- **Nginx**: High-performance, rock-solid web server and reverse proxy.

---

## Testing

Keeping things solid and bug-free:

- **RSpec**: Ruby testing that feels natural.
- **Playwright**: End-to-end testing that ensures my apps behave under pressure.

---

## Cloud & DevOps

Here’s where I scale and automate everything:

- **AWS**: My workhorse for cloud infrastructure.
- **DigitalOcean**: When I need simplicity and speed.
- **Cloudflare**: Performance, security, and CDN all in one.
- **GitHub/GitHub Actions**: Code, version control, and CI/CD pipelines under one roof.
- **Terraform**: Infrastructure as Code that keeps my cloud setup clean and repeatable.
- **Kamal**: Rails deployment made simple with Docker.
- **Tailscale**: Zero-fuss VPN for secure, private networking.
- **1Password**: Secrets, passwords, and sanity management.

---

## AI & Analytics

I’m always tinkering with AI and staying observant with my apps:

- **OpenAI**: Tapping into cutting-edge AI models (thanks, GPT!).
- **Anthropic**: More AI power with Claude for advanced use cases.
- **Axiom**: Observability done right for logs, metrics, and more.
- **Ollama**: Local LLMs on my machine. No cloud required.
- **Vector**: A lightweight, ultra-fast tool for building observability pipelines

---

## Operating System & Shell Tools

I live in the terminal, and these tools keep me efficient:

- **Ubuntu**: The backbone of my dev and server environments.
- **Bash**: Scripting and automating tasks like a pro.
- **nano**: Lightweight editor when I need quick fixes in the terminal.

---

## IDE & Editors

Where I spend most of my time:

- **VSCode**: Lightweight, extensible, and perfect for just about anything I throw at it.

---

## Containerisation & Orchestration

Portability, scalability, and simplicity:

- **Docker**: The backbone of my deployments and development environments.

---

## Monitoring & Load Testing

Keeping my apps healthy and resilient:

- **Prometheus**: Metrics and alerts to keep an eye on performance.
- **K6**: Load testing to make sure my apps don’t break under pressure.

---

## Final Thoughts

The right tools make all the difference, and this stack reflects the choices that keep me productive, curious, and excited about what I build. Whether it's crafting APIs, scaling applications, or tinkering with AI, this setup has me covered for 2025.

If you’re working with a similar stack or are curious about anything I’m using, I’m always keen to chat tech and see how others are pushing the boundaries with these tools.
