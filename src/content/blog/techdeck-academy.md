```
Greetings,
I received your letter regarding:

# To Linus...
Here are my thoughts:

Right, Dean. So you're a DevOps engineer, huh? 'Senior' you say. We'll see about that. Your list of skills and goals isn't exactly groundbreaking – it's the standard DevOps boilerplate. But I'll give you this: you at least know what you *don't* know, which is more than I can say for most. No fluffy introductions, you want the hard stuff. Fine. Your focus on production systems, scalable AWS, and robust CI/CD is...acceptable. Don't expect hand-holding. I'm not here to teach you the basics. Your self-assessment appears mostly accurate, though 'comfortable' with AWS is a weak statement; we'll find out how comfortable you really are. I'll send you some proper challenges shortly. Prepare to be tested. Don't disappoint me. And for the love of all that is holy, keep your code clean. Anything less is unacceptable.
Best regards,

Linus Torvalds
(Your AI Mentor)
```

6. **Generate and Receive a Challenge**:
   - Trigger the send-challenge workflow again
   - You'll receive a challenge email like this:

```
Greetings,
Secure and Scalable Web App Deployment with Terraform and Kubernetes
Create a Terraform configuration to deploy a simple web application to AWS using Kubernetes. The application should be containerized using Docker, and the deployment should include security best practices and demonstrate basic scaling capabilities.

Requirements
Create a Dockerfile for a simple Node.js web application (you can use a 'Hello World' example).
Use Terraform to provision the following AWS resources: EC2 instance(s) for Kubernetes nodes (minimum 2, auto-scaling desired), an EKS cluster, an AWS RDS PostgreSQL database instance, an AWS S3 bucket for application assets.
Deploy the containerized application to the EKS cluster using a Kubernetes Deployment and Service.
Implement persistent storage for the application using the AWS RDS database.
Secure the deployment by implementing appropriate IAM policies, network security groups, and Kubernetes RBAC.
Include a basic autoscaling mechanism (Horizontal Pod Autoscaler) based on CPU utilization.

Examples
Example IAM policy should restrict access to only necessary AWS services and resources.
Example Dockerfile:
FROM node:16
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
CMD [ "node", "index.js" ]

Hints
Consider using Terraform modules to simplify the infrastructure definition.

3. Click "Run workflow"
4. This will immediately generate a new challenge based on your configuration

As the documentation explains: "Instead of waiting for schedule you can trigger a workflow manually. This will trigger the welcome phase of the system. You get welcome email, you send introduction to the teacher, teacher responds to your introduction. Instead of waiting for schedule you can trigger the send-challenge workflow again. This generates a challenge and gives you the instructions on how to complete it. You complete the challenge and upload to your github repository and it will do what it needs to do."

```typescript
// Example config.ts - Customize to your learning goals
export const config: Config = {
  userEmail: "your.email@example.com",
  githubUsername: "yourusername",
  topics: {
    typescript: { currentLevel: 3 },
    kubernetes: { currentLevel: 1 },
    terraform: { currentLevel: 2 },
    "aws-ec2": { currentLevel: 3 },
    // Add any topics you want to learn!
  },
  difficulty: 6, // 1-10 scale
  mentorProfile: "linus", // Direct, technically focused feedback
  schedule: {
    challengeFrequency: "threePerWeek", // Get challenges MWF
  },
};
```

The repository includes everything you need to create a comprehensive learning environment:

- **GitHub Actions workflows** that handle challenge generation, submission processing, and progress tracking

## Choose Your Learning Style with AI Mentor Profiles

One of TechDeck Academy's most powerful features is the ability to customize your AI mentor's teaching style to match how you learn best:

- **Direct and challenging** (Linus profile): Blunt, technically-focused feedback that doesn't sugar-coat issues but pushes you to excellence
- **Supportive and encouraging** (coming in hosted version): Positive reinforcement with gentle guidance
- **Detail-oriented and thorough** (coming in hosted version): Comprehensive explanations and deep dives into concepts

Here's what the Linus mentor profile might say about your code:

> Your function isn't just inefficient, it's wastefully rebuilding the entire array on each iteration. This is exactly the kind of thing that makes applications choke under real load. Your O(n²) approach might work for toy examples, but it's completely unacceptable for production code. Refactor this to a single pass using a proper accumulator pattern. And for the love of all that is holy, add some meaningful variable names. What does 'tmp' tell me? Nothing.

Compare this to a supportive profile (coming soon):

> I see you've got the core logic working, great job getting the function to return the correct results! I noticed an opportunity to optimize your approach by reducing the number of array operations. Consider using an accumulator pattern to process everything in a single pass, which would improve performance for larger inputs. Also, descriptive variable names would make your intentions clearer to other developers.

## Real-World Applications and Benefits

TechDeck Academy isn't just about solving abstract problems. The challenges are designed to build practical skills with immediate real-world applications:

- **DevOps engineers** can practice Terraform configurations, Kubernetes deployments, and CI/CD pipeline optimizations
- **Full-stack developers** can sharpen their TypeScript skills, enhance their cloud architecture knowledge, and improve security practices
- **Cloud architects** can tackle complex AWS configuration scenarios and scaling strategies

The system doesn't just make you better at coding challenges, it develops the skills you need for actual production environments and career advancement.
