## üó∫Ô∏è Basic Navigation: TypeScript Types

Let's start with the basics of TypeScript types. These exercises will help you understand how to define and use types effectively.

### Exercise 1: The Crew Manifest

**Task:** Create a type definition for a crew member with the following properties:

- `name` (string)
- `role` (a union type of: `"captain"`, `"firstMate"`, `"navigator"`, `"cook"`)
- `yearsAtSea` (number)
- `skills` (array of strings)
- `isActive` (boolean)

**Instructions:**

- Use a `type` alias.
- Ensure that the `role` property only accepts one of the specified strings.

**Answer and Explanation:**

```typescript
type CrewMember = {
  name: string;
  role: "captain" | "firstMate" | "navigator" | "cook";
  yearsAtSea: number;
  skills: string[];
  isActive: boolean;
};
```

**Explanation:**

- We used a `type` alias called `CrewMember`.
- The `role` property is a union of string literals, ensuring it can only be one of the specified roles.
- `skills` is an array of strings (`string[]`).
- This type can now be used to ensure that any object representing a crew member adheres to this structure.

---

### Exercise 2: Ship's Cargo

**Task:** Define a type for cargo items that includes:

- `weight` (number)
- `value` (number)
- `isFragile` (boolean)
- `destination` (string)

Then, create a type that represents a cargo hold as an array of these items.

**Instructions:**

- Use a `type` alias for the cargo item.
- Define the cargo hold as an array type.

**Answer and Explanation:**

```typescript
type CargoItem = {
  weight: number;
  value: number;
  isFragile: boolean;
  destination: string;
};

type CargoHold = CargoItem[];
```

**Explanation:**

- `CargoItem` is defined as a type with the specified properties.
- `CargoHold` is an array of `CargoItem` (`CargoItem[]`), representing the ship's cargo hold.
- This structure allows us to manage collections of cargo items with type safety.

## ‚öîÔ∏è Battle Stations: Functions & Error Handling

Now that you're familiar with types, let's move on to functions and error handling.

### Exercise 3: Calculate Plunder Share

**Task:** Write a function that takes the total treasure value and the number of crew members, then returns each person's share. Include error handling for invalid inputs.

**Instructions:**

- The function should accept two parameters: `treasureValue` (number) and `crewCount` (number).
- Validate that `treasureValue` is a non-negative number.
- Validate that `crewCount` is a positive integer.
- Use `Math.floor` to return the integer part of each share.
- Throw appropriate errors for invalid inputs.

**Answer and Explanation:**

```typescript
function calculatePlunderShare(treasureValue: number, crewCount: number): number {
  if (treasureValue < 0) {
    throw new Error("Arr! Can't have negative treasure!");
  }
  if (!Number.isInteger(crewCount) || crewCount <= 0) {
    throw new Error("Need at least one crew member to share the booty!");
  }
  return Math.floor(treasureValue / crewCount);
}
```

**Explanation:**

- The function checks for invalid inputs:
  - Negative treasure value.
  - Non-integer or non-positive crew count.
- Uses `Math.floor` to ensure the share is an integer.
- Throws meaningful errors to help identify issues when the function is used.

## üéØ Advanced Maneuvers: Working with Bun

Let's integrate Bun into our exercises, exploring its capabilities alongside TypeScript.

### Exercise 4: Event Processing

**Task:** Using the types from the tutorial, write a function that filters events by type and date range. Test it with the sample data.

**Sample Data:**

```typescript
type BlueskyEventType = "post" | "like" | "repost" | "follow" | "reply" | "quote";

type BlueskyEvent = {
  type: BlueskyEventType;
  uri: string;
  did: string;
  createdAt: string;
};

const sampleEvents: BlueskyEvent[] = [
  {
    type: "post",
    uri: "abc",
    did: "user1",
    createdAt: "2024-03-15T12:00:00Z",
  },
  {
    type: "like",
    uri: "def",
    did: "user2",
    createdAt: "2024-03-14T12:00:00Z",
  },
  // Add more sample events as needed...
];
```

**Instructions:**

- The function should accept an array of `BlueskyEvent`, an event `type`, a `startDate`, and an `endDate`.
- Return an array of events that match the type and fall within the date range.
- Use proper date comparisons.

**Answer and Explanation:**

```typescript
function filterEvents(
  events: BlueskyEvent[],
  type: BlueskyEventType,
  startDate: Date,
  endDate: Date
): BlueskyEvent[] {
  return events.filter((event) => {
    const eventDate = new Date(event.createdAt);
    return (
      event.type === type &&
      eventDate >= startDate &&
      eventDate <= endDate
    );
  });
}

// Example usage:
const filteredEvents = filterEvents(
  sampleEvents,
  "post",
  new Date("2024-03-14T00:00:00Z"),
  new Date("2024-03-16T00:00:00Z")
);

console.log(filteredEvents);
```

**Explanation:**

- The `filterEvents` function filters events based on the specified type and date range.
- Converts `createdAt` strings to `Date` objects for accurate comparison.
- Returns a new array containing only the events that meet the criteria.
- The example usage demonstrates how to call the function and output the results.

## üó°Ô∏è Sword Fighting: Database Operations

Now we'll delve into database operations using SQLite with Bun's built-in support.

### Exercise 5: The Ship's Log

**Task:** Write SQLite queries to:

1. Create a table for ship's log entries.
2. Insert a new log entry.
3. Retrieve all entries for a specific date.
4. Update the status of an entry.
5. Delete entries older than 30 days.

**Instructions:**

- Use Bun's SQLite module (`bun:sqlite`).
- Define the table with appropriate columns.
- Ensure that date comparisons are handled correctly in queries.

**Answer and Explanation:**

```typescript
import { Database } from "bun:sqlite";

const db = new Database("ship_log.db");

// 1. Create table
db.run(`
  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS ship_log (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    date TEXT,
    entry TEXT,
    status TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
  );
`);

// 2. Insert entry
db.run(
  "INSERT INTO ship_log (date, entry, status) VALUES (?, ?, ?);",
  "2024-03-15",
  "Spotted a Kraken off the starboard bow!",
  "Open"
);

// 3. Retrieve entries by date
const entries = db.query("SELECT * FROM ship_log WHERE date = ?;").all("2024-03-15");
console.log(entries);

// 4. Update status
db.run("UPDATE ship_log SET status = ? WHERE id = ?;", "Closed", 1);

// 5. Delete entries older than 30 days
db.run("DELETE FROM ship_log WHERE date < date('now', '-30 days');");
```

**Explanation:**

- **Create Table:** Sets up the `ship_log` table if it doesn't already exist.
- **Insert Entry:** Adds a new log entry into the `ship_log` table.
- **Retrieve Entries:** Queries the database for entries matching a specific date.
- **Update Status:** Updates the `status` field of a specific log entry.
- **Delete Old Entries:** Removes entries older than 30 days from the current date.

// Initialize the database
const db = new Database("logbook.db");

db.run(`
  CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS logbook (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    date TEXT,
    entry TEXT,
    weather TEXT
  );
`);

const args = process.argv.slice(2);
const command = args[0];

switch (command) {
  case "add":
    // Command: add <date> <weather> <entry>
    const date = args[1];
    const weather = args[2];
    const entry = args.slice(3).join(" ");
    addEntry(date, entry, weather);
    break;

  case "search":
    // Command: search <date>
    const searchDate = args[1];
    searchEntries(searchDate);
    break;

  case "list":
    // Command: list
    listEntries();
    break;

  default:
    console.log("Unknown command. Available commands: add, search, list");
}

function addEntry(date: string, entry: string, weather: string) {
  db.run(
    "INSERT INTO logbook (date, entry, weather) VALUES (?, ?, ?)",
    date,
    entry,
    weather
  );
  console.log("üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è Yarr! Entry added to the logbook!");
}

function searchEntries(date: string) {
  const entries = db.query("SELECT * FROM logbook WHERE date = ?").all(date);
  if (entries.length === 0) {
    console.log("No entries found for that date.");
    return;
  }
  console.log(`\n=== Ship's Log for ${date} ===\n`);
  entries.forEach((entry: any) => {
    console.log(`Weather: ${entry.weather}`);
    console.log(`Entry: ${entry.entry}\n`);
  });
}

function listEntries() {
  const entries = db.query("SELECT * FROM logbook ORDER BY date DESC").all();
  if (entries.length === 0) {
    console.log("The logbook is empty.");
    return;
  }
  console.log("\n=== Ship's Log Entries ===\n");
  entries.forEach((entry: any) => {
    console.log(`Date: ${entry.date}`);
    console.log(`Weather: ${entry.weather}`);
    console.log(`Entry: ${entry.entry}\n`);
  });
}
```

**Explanation:**

- **Command-Line Parsing:** Uses `process.argv` to determine which command to execute.
- **Commands:**
  - `add`: Adds a new entry to the logbook.
  - `search`: Retrieves entries for a specific date.
  - `list`: Lists all entries in the logbook.
- **Functions:**

## üèÜ Captain's Challenge: System Design

Now, let's tackle a higher-level challenge focused on system architecture.

### Exercise 7: Scale the Fleet

**Task:** Design a system that can handle multiple ships' worth of data. Consider:

1. How would you shard the database?
2. How would you handle concurrent updates?
3. What caching strategy would you implement?
4. How would you ensure data consistency?

**Instructions:**

- Write a detailed proposal in markdown format.
- Address each point thoroughly, explaining your reasoning.
- Consider the trade-offs of your design choices.

**Answer and Explanation:**

```markdown
# Fleet Scale Architecture Proposal

## 1. Database Sharding

- **Shard by Ship ID:**
  - Partition the database horizontally based on `ship_id`.
  - Each shard contains data for a subset of ships.
- **Advantages:**
  - Distributes load and improves performance.
  - Simplifies data retrieval for individual ships.
- **Considerations:**
  - Requires a routing mechanism to direct queries to the correct shard.
  - Cross-shard queries become more complex.

## 2. Handling Concurrent Updates

- **Optimistic Concurrency Control:**
  - Use version numbers or timestamps for records.
  - Upon update, check if the record has been modified since it was read.
- **Implementation:**
  - Include a `version` field in records.
  - If a conflict is detected, retry the operation or inform the user.
- **Benefits:**
  - Reduces lock contention.
  - Suitable for systems with frequent reads and fewer writes.

## 3. Caching Strategy

- **Use Distributed Caching (e.g., Redis):**
  - Cache frequently accessed data like ship statuses.
- **Cache Invalidation:**
  - Implement mechanisms to invalidate or update cache entries when underlying data changes.
- **Benefits:**
  - Reduces database load.
  - Improves response times for read-heavy operations.

## 4. Ensuring Data Consistency

- **Strong Consistency Models:**
  - Use transactions where necessary to maintain data integrity.
- **Eventual Consistency:**
  - Accept eventual consistency for less critical data to improve performance.
- **Data Replication:**
  - Employ master-slave replication with failover mechanisms.
- **Conflict Resolution:**
  - Define clear rules for resolving conflicts when they occur.

## Additional Considerations

- **Microservices Architecture:**
  - Decompose the system into services (e.g., Ship Service, Fleet Service).
- **API Gateway:**
  - Centralize API management for authentication and routing.
- **Monitoring and Logging:**
  - Implement logging and monitoring tools for visibility and debugging.

**Conclusion**

Designing a scalable system for multiple ships involves balancing performance, scalability, and consistency. By sharding the database, implementing appropriate concurrency controls, and using caching effectively, we can build a robust system capable of handling large amounts of data while maintaining integrity and performance.
```

**Explanation:**

- **Database Sharding:** Proposes sharding by `ship_id` to distribute load.
- **Concurrent Updates:** Suggests optimistic concurrency control to handle simultaneous data modifications.
- **Caching Strategy:** Recommends using distributed caching to enhance read performance.
- **Data Consistency:** Discusses strong vs. eventual consistency and replication strategies.
- **Additional Considerations:** Highlights the importance of system architecture, monitoring, and logging.
