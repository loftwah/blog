You're absolutely correct; this section is handling two distinct setups‚Äîone for a custom domain and another for using GitHub Pages as a handle. Let‚Äôs structure it so each setup is clearly separated, without redundant steps. Here‚Äôs a revised version that distinguishes between the two approaches:

---

## 4. Custom Domain Setup

Bluesky allows you to use a custom domain as your handle, giving your profile a professional edge. You can either set up a domain you own (like `loftwah.com`) or use GitHub Pages (like `loftwah.github.io`) if you don‚Äôt have a personal domain.

### Option 1: Using a Custom Domain (e.g., `loftwah.com`)

If you have a custom domain, you can link it to your Bluesky handle in just a few steps.

1. **Locate Your DID**: In Bluesky, go to **Settings ‚Üí Change Handle ‚Üí Custom Domain**. Your DID (Decentralized Identifier) will be displayed here (e.g., `did:plc:axc7n2yjep6ggdz7fuztluc4`).
2. **Configure Your DNS**: Go to your domain‚Äôs DNS settings and add a **TXT** record with the following details:
   - **Host/Name**: `_atproto`
   - **Type**: `TXT`
   - **Value**: `did=did:plc:YOUR_DID_HERE` (replace `YOUR_DID_HERE` with the DID displayed in Bluesky)
3. **Verify**: Return to **Settings ‚Üí Change Handle ‚Üí Custom Domain** in Bluesky and click **Verify**.

This will set your Bluesky handle to your custom domain.

### Option 2: Using GitHub Pages as Your Handle (e.g., `loftwah.github.io`)

If you don‚Äôt have a custom domain, you can use GitHub Pages to create a professional handle. Here‚Äôs how:

1. **Enable GitHub Pages**:

   - Go to your GitHub repository for the site you want to use as your handle (e.g., `loftwah.github.io`).
   - In **Settings ‚Üí Pages**, select a branch to publish from, typically `main` or `master`, and save.

2. **Create the `.well-known` Folder**:

   - In your repository, create a folder named `.well-known`.
   - Inside this folder, add a file named `atproto-did`. In this file, enter your DID as shown in Bluesky (e.g., `did:plc:axc7n2yjep6ggdz7fuztluc4`).

3. **Add `_config.yml` to Include `.well-known`**:

   - In the root of your repository, create a file named `_config.yml`.
   - Add the following to include `.well-known` in the GitHub Pages build:
     ```yml
     include: [".well-known"]
     ```

4. **Publish and Verify**:
   - Once your GitHub Pages site is live at `https://loftwah.github.io`, go to **Settings ‚Üí Change Handle ‚Üí Custom Domain** in Bluesky, and enter `loftwah.github.io` as your custom domain.
   - Click **Verify** to complete the setup.

For a working example, you can reference this helpful [GitHub repo example](https://github.com/w3cj/w3cj.github.io).

### Option 3: Using GitLab Pages as Your Handle (e.g., `your-username.gitlab.io/your-repo-name`)

If you prefer GitLab Pages, you can set it up similarly to GitHub Pages.

1. **Enable GitLab Pages**:

   - Create a public repository in GitLab (e.g., `loftwah`) and clone it to your local machine.

   - In the repository, create a `.gitlab-ci.yml` file in the root to enable GitLab Pages:

     ```yaml
     pages:
       stage: deploy
       script:
         - mkdir -p public
         - cp -r .well-known public/
       artifacts:
         paths:
           - public
     ```

2. **Create the `.well-known` Folder**:

   - Inside the cloned repository, create a folder named `.well-known`.
   - In `.well-known`, create a file named `atproto-did`, and add your DID as shown in Bluesky (e.g., `did:plc:axc7n2yjep6ggdz7fuztluc4`).

3. **Commit and Push Changes to GitLab**:

   - Save the files, commit, and push your changes:

     ```bash
     git add .
     git commit -m "Add DID verification for GitLab Pages"
     git push origin main
     ```

4. **Find and Use Your GitLab Pages URL**:

   - Once your site is deployed, GitLab will provide a URL like `https://your-username.gitlab.io/your-repo-name`.
   - Go to **Settings ‚Üí Change Handle ‚Üí Custom Domain** in Bluesky and enter your GitLab Pages URL as your custom domain.

5. **Verify**:

   - Once GitLab Pages is live, click **Verify** in Bluesky to complete the setup.

---

For more information on GitLab Pages, check out GitLab‚Äôs documentation [here](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/). This setup allows you to use GitLab Pages as your handle in Bluesky without needing a custom domain.

For a working example, you can reference this helpful [GitLab repo example](https://gitlab.com/loftwah/loftwah.gitlab.io).

## 5. Managing Moderation and Content Preferences

Bluesky provides robust moderation tools to tailor your experience:

- **Content Filters**: Adjust your preferences in **Settings ‚Üí Content Filters**.
- **Reporting**: Manage issues with built-in reporting tools.

## 6. Setting Up the GitHub Labeler Bot

The GitHub Labeler bot (`@github-labeler.bsky.social`) helps you automatically add labels to repositories you contribute to. Here‚Äôs how to set it up correctly, step-by-step.

### Setup Instructions

1. **Follow the Labeler Bot**:

   * Go to the labeler‚Äôs profile: [github-labeler.bsky.social](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:xpxsa5aviwecd7cv6bzbmr5n).
   * Click on the **"..." menu** and select **Follow** to initiate the setup.

2. **Subscribe to the Labeler Bot**:

   * Go back to the labeler‚Äôs profile and select **Subscribe**. This confirms your agreement to allow the bot to interact with your repositories.

3. **Like the Labeler‚Äôs Profile**:

   * **Like** the labeler‚Äôs profile by tapping the heart icon. This step sends a direct message to the bot to confirm setup, allowing it to proceed with verification.

> **Important**: Make sure to follow these steps in the exact order above. If the order is incorrect, you may need to start over by unfollowing and then refollowing the bot to reset the process.

### Verifying Your GitHub Account

Once the initial steps are complete, the bot will prompt you to verify your GitHub account. Here‚Äôs what to do:

1. **Update Your GitHub Profile**:

   * Add your Bluesky handle to your GitHub profile bio. This step is necessary for the bot to verify your GitHub account.

2. **Send Your GitHub Username**:

   * In the chat with the bot, type your GitHub username in the format:

     ```plaintext
     github: loftwah
     ```

3. **Confirmation**:

   * The bot should respond with a success message once your account is verified.

### Linking a GitHub Repository

After verifying your GitHub account, you can link a repository to add labels. Here‚Äôs how:

1. **Send the Repository Name**:

   * In the chat with the bot, type the repository name in the format:

     ```plaintext
     repo: loftwah/linkarooie
     ```

2. **Wait for Confirmation**:

   * The bot will verify your ownership or contributor status for the specified repository and confirm that it qualifies for label management.

3. **Label Assignment**:

   * It may take a few minutes for the label to appear on the specified repository. The bot will automatically handle label updates going forward.

### Troubleshooting Tips

* **Incorrect Setup Order**: If you make a mistake during setup, you can **unfollow** the bot, then follow the steps again from the beginning.
* **Profile Verification Error**: Make sure your GitHub profile includes your Bluesky handle; otherwise, the bot can‚Äôt verify your account.
* **Repo Access Issues**: Only public repositories you own or contribute to can be managed by the labeler.

This setup gives your repositories a professional edge with automated label management on GitHub. Now you‚Äôre ready to stay organized with labels for your contributions!
